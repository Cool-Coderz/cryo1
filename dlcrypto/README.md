# Important
To Keep things modular I will continue hosting this repo [here](https://github.com/GrilledChickenThighs/dlcrypto). Any changes or updates will be pushed to that repo, since it much easier to control edits. If there is a better way to do it, which will keep everything contained under this group I am open to suggestions, but for now, just fork it from my repo and make a pull request.
